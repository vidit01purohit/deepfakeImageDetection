# Deepfake Detection App 🎭🖼️

Welcome to the **Deepfake Detection App**! This application uses advanced deep learning models to detect deepfakes in images. Built using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**, this app enables real-time predictions of whether an uploaded image is **real** or a **deepfake**.

### 🚀 Features:
- **Upload your image**: Simply upload a `.jpg` file for detection.
- **Majority Voting**: Combines predictions from three fine-tuned models—**ResNet50**, **VGG16**, and **InceptionV3**—to deliver the most accurate results.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Receive an immediate prediction along with the confidence score for each model.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Models are cached locally to speed up future predictions.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Streamlit**: Easy-to-use framework for building interactive web apps.
- **TensorFlow**: Powerful machine learning library for building deep learning models.
- **Hugging Face**: Provides fine-tuned models for deepfake detection.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Efficient array operations.

### ⚡️ How It Works:
1. **User uploads an image**: The app accepts `.jpg` images for analysis.
2. **Prediction using three models**: The app uses **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, and **InceptionV3**, all fine-tuned for deepfake detection.
3. **Majority voting mechanism**: The app uses an average probability from the three models to make the final prediction.
4. **Displays result**: The app shows whether the image is **real** or **a deepfake**, along with a confidence score.

### 📦 Installation:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vidit01purohit/deepfakeImageDetection.git
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
